# Cracking the Coding Interview in Rust

This repository contains [Cracking the Coding Interview 6th
edition](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
problems and solutions in Rust. Problems are provided in the `problems` module
with test cases so you can write your own solutions. Solutions are provided in
the separate `solutions` module so you won't be influenced by the correct
answers when approaching problems. Oftentimes, several alternate solutions are
provided for various constraints. Note that this is supplementary material and
the book is recommended for additional advice on interviewing, negotiation, and
how to approach problems. 

## Usage 
To get started, open the file
`src/problems/_01_arrays_and_strings/_01_is_unique.rs`. This corresponds to
chapter 1.1 in the book. You will replace the `impl` for the `Solution` struct
with your code. To run the tests for just this module, use `cargo test
_01_is_unique`. If you are stuck, you can reference the solutions in
`src/solutions/_01_arrays_and_strings/_01_is_unique.rs`. Happy coding!
